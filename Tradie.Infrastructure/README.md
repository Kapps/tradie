# Tradie.Infrastructure

Tradie.Infrastructure is a cdk-tf (Terraform generated via code) IaC project for all Tradie infrastructure.

No solution exists for this project, and due to some terraform asset limitations, this project is
outside of the solution and directory for all other Tradie projects.

Currently this project handles both the building and deploying of Tradie. In the future, one or both
of these will be moved into a proper CI/CD pipeline, which may just use this project.
